                    I am Ike Chen, an aspiring game developer who aims to combine history and games to create unique and powerful works of art that are interesting, educational, and enjoyable.<br>
                    The Aichi E16A Zuiun is my favourite plane (a seaplane!), although I actually know very little about it. My miniscule online presence is almost entirely based on it.</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>I built this website almost entirely by myself, although I used MDN Web Docs and StackOverflow for some implementation help.</li>
                        <li>This website's design was inspired by <a href = "https://big-stupid-jellyfish.github.io/GFMath/index" target = "_blank">GFMath</a>.</li>
                        <li>Almost everything on this site is dynamically populated using JavaScript. This makes it more maintainable at the cost of performance. I did this as a proof of concept.</li>
                        <li>All of the History articles are placeholders until I sort out sourcing issues. The unsourced versions can be accessed by adding <code>_old</code> to the file name.</li>
