                    I am Ike Chen, an aspiring game developer who aims to combine history and games to create unique and powerful works of art that are interesting, educational, and enjoyable.

                    The Aichi E16A Zuiun is one of the greatest seaplanes ever invented (and the best that Japan ever managed to produce in decent numbers).
                    I love the plane so much that my miniscule online presence is almost entirely based on it, although I don't actually know the plane's specifications in detail.
