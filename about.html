                    I'm Ike Chen, an aspiring game developer who aims to combine history and games to create unique and powerful works of art that are interesting, educational, and enjoyable.

                    The Aichi E16A Zuiun is my favourite plane; my online presence is almost entirely based on it.

                    <p>
                        I built this website entirely on my own, without using React or any other framework.
                        Its design was inspired by <a href = "https://big-stupid-jellyfish.github.io/GFMath/index" target = "_blank">GFMath</a>.
                        <br>
                        An earlier iteration of this website used JavaScript to dynamically populate most pages.
                        I took that functionality out as it was largely unnecessary, but it worked as a proof of concept.
