                    <h2>Battle of the Mediterranean<sup><a href = "#mediterranean">#</a></sup></h2>
                    <p>
                        The Mediterranean campaign is one of the most overlooked yet important campaigns in the Second World War. The Axis needed oil, the Allies needed supply lines, and both needed to stop the other.
                        The campaign may not be particularly famous today, but it left a major mark on the course of the war and even on the Maltese national identity.
                    </p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>Establishing Control</dt>
                        <dd>
                            Italy and France are usually the butts of every war joke, but they, along with the UK, played major roles during the opening phases of the Battle of the Mediterranean.
                            Naturally, whoever controlled the Mediterranean controlled the "soft underbelly" of Europe (a very exaggerated expression), which was a strategic position that nobody could afford to ignore.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    France's surrender was ironically a significant factor in why the Axis never seized control of the Mediterranean.
                                    The unreasonably large and powerful French navy remained neutral and therefore out of German hands, meaning Italy would be forced to contest naval superiority mostly by itself.
                                    This single (in)action essentially sealed the fate of the Axis in the Mediterranean, barring British incompetence (which happened mostly in the Pacific).
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            The French navy's limbo would come to an end rather violently.
                                            The British, afraid of the Germans commandeering the French navy, decided to destroy nearly all of it in a coordinated strike on Mers-el-Kébir (Operation Catapult).
                                            With one action, the threat of Axis naval power in the Mediterranean reduced drastically. This was, unsurprisingly, not very popular among the French.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Afterwards, what most of remained of the French navy remained loyal to the Vichy regime - at least, until the Germans actually tried to seize the remaining French ships at Toulon.
                                            The French responded by scuttling nearly all of what remained of their once-formidable navy, which, at this point in the war, ended any chance of Axis naval superiority in the Mediterranean.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    There was a battle at Taranto which resulted in the Italian navy being severely crippled, although many of the damaged ships were repaired merely months later.
                                    Although the action at Taranto is called a "battle," it would probably be better to classify it as a "tickle-fight."
                                    British aircraft essentially torpedoed the ships docked at Taranto with impunity, but failed to do any lasting damage even though the Italians also failed to do anything to stop the British.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li><a href = "https://www.nationalww2museum.org/war/articles/taranto-november-1940" target = "_blank">A surprise air raid intended to permanently cripple an enemy fleet? Sounds familiar.</a></li>
                                        <li>After Taranto, the Italians got their revenge by using a manned torpedo to sink HMS Queen Elizabeth in Alexandria's harbour. This may be the saddest and strangest action of the entire war.</li>
                                        <li>
                                            Taranto may seem to justify the jokes about Italy, but the Italian navy was not meant to fight; it was a fleet-in-being. Its purpose was to sit in port and stretch the British thin by acting threatening.
                                            If the Italians ever sortied out in large numbers, which they did on occasion with <a href = "https://www.bbc.co.uk/history/ww2peopleswar/timeline/factfiles/nonflash/a1151740.shtml" target = "_blank">disastrous results</a>,
                                            they would have sacrificed their entire navy for a temporary advantage. It was much better to maintain the threat of sortieing in order to force the British into stretching themselves thin with constant patrols.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    When the Allies invaded the Maghreb (Operation Torch), the Americans encountered Jean Bart, a French battleship that was still under construction at the time.
                                    Somehow, Jean Bart put up an incredible fight despite being incomplete, and for this reason I find it very disrespectful that she was only completed after the war and mostly kept in reserve afterwards.
                                </li>
                            </ul>

                        <dd>
                            Malta had an outsized influence on the Mediterranean campaign, and this is memorialised on <a href = "https://revealmalta.com/culture/history-behind-maltese-flag/" target = "_blank">her national flag</a>.
                            The ancient Maltese tradition of <a href = "https://www.britannica.com/event/Siege-of-Malta" target = "_blank">being ridiculously difficult to conquer</a> remained true during the war.
                            <ul>
                                <li id = "text-2">
                                    Malta's importance comes from its central position in the Mediterranean. There are only three entrances into the Mediterranean: Gibraltar, the Bosporus, and Suez.
                                    Besides Malta, the British could only project power from Gibraltar and Egypt. This meant that Malta could control the sea and air lanes that were unreachable from Gibraltar and Alexandria (Italy and Libya).
                                    The success of the North African campaign rested partially on the fact that Malta, used as an airbase, could be used to effectively interdict enemy shipping.<sup><a href = "#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup>
                                    On the other hand, being able to project power far into the Mediterranean was double-edged, as Malta was unreachable from Gibraltar and Egypt without having to run a gauntlet of ships and planes.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    The Siege of Malta lasted more than two years, slightly longer than Leningrad, though was nowhere near as destructive. This does not discount the bravery of the defenders.
                                    The inhabitants of Malta survived while being severely isolated and cut-off from supplies for two years, maintaining an aggressive air campaign while facing incredibly unfavourable odds.
                                    Naturally, there were multiple attempts to relieve the island. Some were successful, but many were not.
                                    Operation Vigorous, in which the convoy's ships all either sank or turned back, was an example of a very unsuccessful attempt.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    In the end, Malta was saved by the extremely daring Operation Pedestal, which is objectively the coolest name of all time.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Operation Pedestal was a desperate attempt at sending a supply convoy to Malta, whose defenders were running out of food and fuel.
                                            With only a few weeks of fuel left, the British would not have been able to defend Malta if Operation Pedestal failed.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            The Santa Maria Convoy, as it came to be called, consisted of several battleships and aircraft carriers, along with dozens of lighter screening ships.
                                            An American oil tanker, Ohio, was also seized to carry fuel supplies. The sheer number of ships that the British were gambling with proves just how vital they considered Malta to be.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            The convoy set off from Gibraltar, facing constant aerial and naval attacks from the Italians and the Germans. One carrier was sunk and many of the escorting ships were forced to turn back.
                                            Ohio, whose survival was paramount to Malta's survival, was also severely damaged, but the survivors pushed onwards.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            As the convoy approached Malta, the air attacks continued and it became clear that Ohio was going to sink.
                                            Desperate to prevent this from happening, the British forcibly kept Ohio together by strapping it to two destroyers and a minesweeper and towed it to Grand Harbour.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            Ultimately, Ohio sank in Grand Harbour - but only after the fuel on board was pumped out.
                                            Hundreds had died and over a dozen ships were lost, but Malta had received over ten weeks worth of supplies. Malta, along with the entire North African front, was saved.

                    <h2>Titans of the Pacific<sup><a href = "#pacific">#</a></sup></h2>
                    <p>
                        Hearts of Iron IV players sometimes say that naval warfare is the most boring part of the game. However, I think that the most interesting parts of the Second World War were the naval campaigns, especially the Pacific War.
                        Much like the Eastern Front, it was a <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/1920643.Clash_of_Titans" target = "_blank">"Clash of Titans"</a>--literally, in the case of the Yamato-class battleships--and the US was the greatest titan of them all.
                        Even so, some people claim that the Japanese navy was overwhelmingly superior to the American navy in terms of quality (probably the same people who make the same erroneous claim about the German and the Soviet armies).
                        This may have been true at the beginning of the war, but not so afterwards. Still, the claim is not entirely baseless, and many ships on both sides were rather interesting.
                    </p>
                    <dl>
                        <dt>United States Navy</dt>

                                <li>
                                    It is by now a well-known fact that it was physically impossible for the US to lose the Pacific War.
                                    In later stages of the war, the US was building aircraft carriers in mere months, while Japan struggled to bulid any during the entire duration of the war.
                                    Additionally, the US produced thousands of "Liberty ships" (cargo ships) - in other words, more than one ship per day!

                                <li>Many American ships received nicknames for their feats during the war. Unfortunately, USS Intrepid at some point received a creative insult - "Decrepit."</li>

                                    Before Star Trek, there was another USS Enterprise, an aircraft carrier, which gained a rather fearsome reputation.
                                    She served in essentially every major engagement and was resultingly the most decorated ship of the war.

                                            Enterprise was one of the few pre-war American carriers (besides USS Saratoga and USS Ranger) to have survived the entire war.
                                            <ul>
                                                <li>Of these, only Enterprise and Saratoga were actively involved in battle, as Ranger was essentially limited to patrol duty in the North Atlantic (besides Operation Torch).</li>
                                                <li>After the war, Saratoga was destroyed in a nuclear test (Operation Crossroads, which was a horrendous waste of potential memorial ships despite its strategic significance) and Ranger was scrapped.</li>
                                                <li>
                                                    Enterprise was the last pre-war carrier to be retired and was scrapped rather than preserved as a memorial ship, for some unfathomable reason.
                                                    It will forever infuriate me that I will never be able to visit Enterprise.

                                            For a short period of time, Enterprise was the only operational American carrier in the Pacific. Sailors aboard the ship apparently hung up a banner labeled "Enterprise vs Japan."
                                            Unfortunately, I cannot find any pictures of it. It must have been the greatest moment of the war.

                                    Two destroyers, Shigure and Yukikaze, became known for being unsinkable "miracle ships," although Shigure eventually sank. Both ships faced engagements where they were only survivors, which also gave them a reputation of being cursed.

                                            Shigure might be the more famous of the two in the West, as one of her captains (Tameichi Hara) was the only Japanese destroyer captain to have survived the entire war and wrote a memoir about his experiences.<sup><a href = "#footnote-3">[3]</a></sup>
                                            He was also an important developer of destroyer battle doctrine, although it is difficult to say exactly how much influence he had.

                                            Yukikaze is, on the other hand, incredibly famous in Japan. After all, she managed to survive the war, and even became a flagship.

                                                    Tan Yang served as the flagship of the Chinese navy for twenty years, and her rudder was returned to Japan after she was retired. In the end, Yukikaze never sank.

                                    The Ise-class battleships, my favourite battleship class, are subjects of major curiosity due to Japan's terrible situation after Midway - specifically, her utter dearth of operable carriers.
                                    Japan's response to this was converting battleships to carriers, a tried-and-true (?) strategy that must have been taken under extreme desperation by the admiralty.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            Shinano was the only full conversion to come about as a result of Midway; the Ise-class battleships were converted into "aviation battleships" with the capability to handle some planes, including Zuiuns.
                                            They never really managed to serve in this role, since the Japanese were chronically short on planes and pilots for the remainder of the war.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            It is unfortunate that the aviation battleship concept was unsuccessful.
                                            The partial conversion which took place did not enable the Ise-class battleships to carry conventional carrier planes, given the small size of their flight decks.
                                            However, if somehow a different compromise was made, two classes of capital ships might have been married together into one super-capital ship. That would have been interesting.

                                    The Fubuki-class destroyers were known as the "special-type destroyers" because of how ridiculously powerful they were at the time of their construction; they were basically cruisers.
                                    However, none of them became particularly famous, although two of them (Hibiki and Ushio) did survive the war - a testament to their resilience. The only other pre-war destroyer to survive was the Kagerō-class Yukikaze.

                                    Still, it takes some ridiculous bravery to charge a superior naval formation, with the American formation completely shattering as a result.

                            Hara's memoirs are interesting, but they should be read with care; he was almost certainly trying to win sympathy for the Japanese. For example, Hara had no reason to even mention the Rape of Nanking, much less call it "exaggerated."

                    <p>
                        "Battle" is a restrictive word. Leyte Gulf consisted of several battles, and it should honestly be considered an entire operation (the battle was caused by Operation Shō-Gō 1).
                        These engagements collectively formed the Battle of Leyte Gulf, a sort of <a href = "https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/50896142-twilight-of-the-gods" target = "_blank">"twilight"</a> for the Japanese navy.
                        It is sometimes considered the largest naval battle in history, and there has never been a battle like it, nor will there ever be again.

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            To be clear, the battle as a whole was a suicidal action. It was the decisive battle that the Japanese had been waiting for, the one action that would end the war.
                            Both sides pooled their forces together, with the Japanese knowing that they only stood a chance with their fleets coalesced, and the Allies knowing that one strike could destroy the entire Japanese navy.
                            By then, the Japanese were hopelessly outnumbered, outgunned, and outmanoeuvred, and total defeat was imminent if they could not pull off several successive, impossible miracles.

                            The confrontation began with the Battle of the Sibuyan Sea. The Third Fleet engaged the Kurita Fleet in a furious air battle, which resulted in the sinking of Musashi, one of the largest battleships ever built.
                            Musashi never ended up firing her massive guns at surface targets, showing just how badly her usefulness was squandered by keeping her and Yamato in port as "hotels" for eternity.
                            Not much else occurred, and Halsey decided to pursue the Ozawa Fleet, believing the Kurita Fleet to have been neutralised.

                            The Battle of Surigao Strait followed, as Nishimura attempted to force the Surigao Strait.

                                    This battle was a disastrous defeat for Japan, and is the subject of <a href = "#songs">the previously-mentioned song about Shigure</a>.
                                    The entirety of the Nishimura Fleet sank with the exception of Shigure. Japanese support forces arrived after the battle ended and ironically sank Mogami, a would-be survivor, by crashing into her.

                                    Notably, this was the last battle ever fought between battleships. Though battleships contributed to the American victory, it is likely that the Americans would have won even without them.
                                    It was the end of an era.

                            The next engagement, the Battle off Samar, is incredibly famous for the tenacity of the American forces.

                                    The Seventh Fleet did not have any fleet carriers. It had escort carriers, which were slow and poorly armed.
                                    Imagine Kinkaid's surprise when the Kurita Fleet suddenly appeared, seemingly out of nowhere, to attack said carrier group.

                                <li>
                                    This fight was one against severe odds. The American unit, Taffy 3, consisted of destroyers, destroyer escorts, and escort carriers. Kurita had battleships, cruisers, and destroyers.
                                    The ensuing battle, however, made the disparity seem more like an equality.
                                </li>

                                    With the escort carriers retreating, the destroyers and destroyer escorts charged the Kurita Fleet under the cover of smoke and rain to buy time for the carriers to escape.
                                    Two ships deserve special mention for their actions, but all of the sailors involved displayed incredible gallantry in the face of certain death.

                                            USS Johnston, being closest to the Japanese, led the counterattack.
                                            The chaos caused by her charge prevented any effective Japanese response, and she disabled Kumano, a heavy cruiser, while being pelted with battleship fire.
                                            When Johnston finally sank under a ridiculous amount of punishment, Yukikaze passed by and her sailors saluted the sinking ship.

                                            USS Samuel B Roberts was a destroyer escort. She was never meant to engage surface ships in combat.
                                            Even so, she followed Johnston and charged at Chōkai and Chikuma, two heavy cruisers, causing severe damage to both.
                                            Roberts was finally sunk by battleship fire, and for her actions, she became known as "the destroyer escort that fought like a battleship."

                                    </ul>

                                    While the screening ships were distracting the Kurita Fleet, the escort carriers of Taffy 3 sent out their air wings and even used their wildly ineffective (one-per-carrier) guns in a desperate attempt to stop the Kurita Fleet.
                                    They would sink numerous cruisers in the process, which convinced Kurita that he was facing the main American carrier fleet.

                                    Kinkaid was not merely standing by and watching the battle; he called for help from the Third Fleet.
                                    Chester Nimitz, the overall commander of all American naval forces in the Pacific, eventually sent his own message to Halsey, which would become famous.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>
                                            American encoding practice dictated that both ends of messages be filled with useless padding, separated from the actual text by two letters, in order to make them harder to decode.
                                            This is because messages usually begin and end with similar phrases, such as "Sincerely."
                                        </li>
                                        <li>Halsey's full message was <code>TURKEY TROTS TO WATER GG FROM CINCPAC ACTION COM THIRD FLEET INFO COMINCH CTF SEVENTY-SEVEN X WHERE IS RPT WHERE IS TASK FORCE THIRTY FOUR RR THE WORLD WONDERS</code>.</li>
                                        <li>The beginning padding was <code>TURKEY TROTS TO WATER GG</code>. When Halsey received the message, this portion was correctly deleted.</li>
                                        <li>
                                            The actual message was <code>FROM CINCPAC ACTION COM THIRD FLEET INFO COMINCH CTF SEVENTY-SEVEN X WHERE IS RPT WHERE IS TASK FORCE THIRTY FOUR</code>, stating the sender (<code>CINCPAC</code> [Nimitz's position]),
                                            the intended recipient (<code>THIRD FLEET</code>), and the message (<code>WHERE IS RPT WHERE IS TASK FORCE THIRTY FOUR</code>). Task Force 34, a large battleship force, was supposed to be supporting the Seventh Fleet,
                                            but Halsey had taken it north with him and did not tell Kinkaid or Nimitz, leading both to assume that it <em>should have</em> been able to relieve Taffy 3.
                                        </li>
                                        <li>
                                            The ending padding was <code>RR THE WORLD WONDERS</code>. When Halsey received the message, this portion was incorrectly retained.
                                            "[T]he world wondered" is a key line in "The Charge of the Light Brigade," a famous poem (that we all probably studied in school) about a suicidal cavalry charge during the Battle of Balaclava.
                                            This battle took place exactly ninety years prior to the Battle off Samar - coincidence or otherwise, the resemblance between the two battles is striking.

                                        <li>The result of this was that Halsey, believing that Nimitz was sardonically questioning his strategy, had something of a breakdown. He sent Task Force 34 south, but it arrived too late to do anything.</li>
                                    </ul>
                                </li>
                                <li>Ultimately, this battle was an extremely costly American victory. Taffy 3 had repelled a far superior force with heavy losses, and the Kurita Fleet could no longer contest the American landings.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            While the Battle off Samar was raging, the Third Fleet had discovered the Ozawa Fleet and was engaging it in the Battle off Cape Engaño.
                            The Ozawa Fleet's fate was sealed from the start: without any planes or trained pilots, all the Japanese could do was try to escape as American bombers destroyed ship after ship. Every carrier in the Ozawa Fleet was sunk and few other ships survived.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The Battle of Leyte Gulf thus ended in a resounding victory for the Americans, despite major losses at Samar. The Japanese navy was ended as an effective fighting force, with its numbers so greatly reduced that it could never be a threat again.
                            Japan lost access to oil and other resources in Malaya, which meant that the few remaining ships and aircraft would be unable to sortie.
                            Other than a lengthy cat-and-mouse engagement at Ormoc Bay, the Japanese navy would not be a significant part of the war any longer.
