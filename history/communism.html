                    <p>
                        When people are first taught about communism, they are often told that communism is an economic system, not a political system.
                        This oversimplification is understandable, but the ideology which so greatly defined the twentieth-century deserves more explanation than that.
                        It is truly telling that the only genuine supporters of communism (and by this definition I do not include statists or Soviet nationalists) are those who have never lived through it.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Communism is fundamentally a form of philosophy. It is a theory of evolution that was intended to solve all of the world's problems at once.
                            By contrast, liberalism was an economic theory that became political and social over time, but communism was conceived as an all-encompassing ideology centred around class conflict.
                            It probably comes as no surprise that Marxism is an important component of political economics, though its proponents are generally not communists. This perspective, Karl Marx's theory of evolution, is essentially as follows:
                            <ol>
                                <li>
                                    Humanity began as egalitarian hunter-gatherer societies. These were tightly bound in kinship groups and were more-or-less utopian.
                                    This idea, closely tied to the noble savage, was very popular in the nineteenth-century, and not only among communists.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Over time, these kinship groups came together to steal from other groups, ie warfare. Naturally, some people held more power than the others, and this would eventually result in the state.
                                    It is important to note that, in communist thought, the state is considered to be a form of oppression.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    As states grew, the differences between the lower and the upper classes also grew. The upper classes relied on the labour of the lower classes, whether as farmers or soldiers, for their wealth.
                                    At some point, the state grew so large that it resulted in feudalism - a stratified society where each class demands tribute from the classes below it.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Of course, the lower classes were not happy with being exploited at all times. There were lower class uprisings all throughout history, but no lower class revolutions.
                                    Revolutions were begun by the middle classes who had more to gain by exploiting the trust of the lower class, then betraying them later by replacing the upper class.
                                    In communist thought, every war and conflict is considered either a rebellion against the upper class by the lower class or an attempt by the upper class to exploit the lower class.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Eventually, states grew so large that capitalism, spurred along by industrialisation, came along and replaced feudalism. There were now two equally oppressed classes, the workers and the peasants.
                                    Furthermore, nationalism developed at this time, uniting the lower classes with the upper classes, at least in theory. Nationalism is therefore considered an instrument of oppression in most, but not all, communist ideologies.
                                </li>
                                <li id = "text-1">
                                    The productive forces of capitalism would eventually result in a society where there is enough produced for everyone, but never distributed to everyone.
                                    Not only that, but this state of society was considered an inevitable consequence of capitalism. This would be the ideal (and inevitable) time for a communist revolution.
                                    Marx conceived this as a necessarily global revolution, as a localised revolution would be crushed by outside forces. It is now believed that a global revolution is impossible.<sup><a href = "#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup>
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    After the communist revolution, the workers would form a "dictatorship of the proletariat" (lower communism). The peasants were not considered to have enough "class consciousness" to lead a revolution.
                                    There are diverging theories of evolution at this point, but in any case this new state was to crush all counter-revolutionary elements (violently) and prepare the people for a transition into a communist society.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Finally, after the elimination of class differences (education, wealth, and otherwise), the state would be abolished entirely and the people would now live in a communist society,
                                    where everyone worked to produce something and where there was always enough production such that stealing was unnecessary.
                                </li>
                            </ol>

                        <li>
                            Communism is a socialist economic theory. Lower communism is statist, while the communist society is communal. My interpretation here follows Vladimir Lenin more than it does Marx,
                            as no communist state (Catalonia skipped lower communism) permanently maintained communal socialism during lower communism, nor did any communist state ever emerge from it.
                            State capitalism or market socialism, ie what China follows, is incredibly un-communist, but I will discuss it for the sake of completeness.
                            <dl>
                                <dt>Statism</dt>
                                <dd>
                                    Statism is what most people call socialism; ie it is the distribution of resources and the control of production according to the state.
                                    During lower communism, the state would equitably redistribute resources to ensure prosperity for all, but in practice it was not so equitable.
                                    Ultimately, lower communism is merely supposed to serve as a stepping stone towards true communism. This is presumably how most Chinese delude themselves into believing that they live in a truly communist state.
                                </dd>
                                <dt>Communalism</dt>
                                <dd>
                                    Communalism is the hallmark of nineteenth-century utopianism and is based on communes which produce everything the inhabitants need so long as they all participate in production.
                                    This is the origin of the word communism (from commune), and is understandably the end goal of communism.
                                    There are no communist societies in the world today, and I only know of a few past examples:
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>The progenitor, so to speak, of the communist society is Paris, which only lasted two months before being captured.</li>
                                        <li>Catalonia is almost as famous as Paris, since it was the largest and most successful communist society, with George Orwell's participation in the May Days being a major contributor to her fame.</li>
                                        <li>During the Russian Civil War, there were some factions which were certainly communal (Greens) and arguably even communist (Blacks), although none really mobilised the workers or followed Marxist evolutionary philosophy.</li>
                                        <li>Unfortunately, information on Shinmin is pretty sparse and I will withhold judgement until I can learn more.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                    China's economy is a fusion of socialism and capitalism in which the state essentially competes against itself through state-owned enterprises.
                                    Hsiao-ping Teng's implementation of this system was "justified" by China's historical lack of a capitalist economy, which would have produced the industry necessary for lower communism.<sup><a href = "#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>State capitalism is obviously not entirely capitalist, no matter how much leeway these state enterprises have, and it is essentially institutional exploitation.</li>
                                        <li>Market socialism is more market than socialist, since there is basically no collective ownership and no redistribution of wealth outside of wages, which already exist in a capitalist economy.</li>
                                        <li>In other words, no matter what you call it, <a href = "https://psmag.com/politics-and-law/three-ways-of-looking-at-the-prcs-latest-campaigns-22799" target = "_blank">China's economic system is rather un-communist</a>.</li>

                            Communism is variously described as democratic, autocratic, and anarchic. All three are true to some extent in some instances, at least in theory.
                            <dl>
                                <dt>Democratic</dt>
                                <dd>
                                    Communism is sometimes contentiously (generally falsely) considered democratic. This depends on the particular strand of communism under consideration, as democratic strands of communism deviate significantly from mainstream Marxism.
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Lenin believed in "democratic centralism," which was free debate until a conclusion was achieved, after which no dissent was tolerated. This is only tenuously democratic and ended when Iosif Stalin came to power.</li>
                                        <li>
                                            Some communists believe in multiparty democracy, and such parties prove their popularity in elections throughout the world (Moldavia, Nepal, Italy, France, among others).
                                            However, most communists see this as playing second-fiddle to bourgeois parties and do not approve; this is understandable, as all of these states are predominantly capitalist despite the strength of their communist parties.
                                        </li>
                                    </ul>
                                </dd>

                                <dd>
                                    Without question, communism is autocratic, if the name "dictatorship of the proletariat" was not a giveaway.
                                    Brutal repression of actual or suspected counter-revolutionaries is common in communist regimes, and Marx even considered it a prerequisite to building a communist society.
                                    This is why communism is inherently inhumane, regardless of the ideals it espouses. Some communists will speak of democratic dictatorships, but they are democratic only among the vanguard (if even that) and dictatorial otherwise.
                                </dd>
                                <dt>Anarchic</dt>
                                <dd>
                                    Communism is theoretically anarchic, but my only known example is Catalonia. Given that communists see the state as inherently exploitative, abolition of the state after eliminating class differences is necessary to create true communism.
                                    Production and organisation would then consist of free association, similar to libertarianism. This is rather idealistic, to say the least.

                            The failure of the German Revolution was key to this change in thought. Additionally, the blatant hatred of communism in the US, even among the far left, makes a truly global revolution impossible.
                            Ever since Lev Trotsky and his "permanent revolution" were defeated in the Soviet power struggle, nobody has seriously supported global revolution.<sup><a href = "#text-1">^</a></sup>
