                    <h2>From Admiral to Regent<sup><a href = "#admiral-regent">#</a></sup></h2>
                    <p>
                        Horthy had a rather unexpected beginning. Despite Hungary being known primarily as a land power (Hungarian hordes in the Carpathian basin, etc), Horthy chose to join the navy.
                        After becoming an admiral, the title became inseparable from Horthy's name, although the fame he accrued from his service could not reverse his advanced age.
                        Horthy probably just wanted to retire after the Great War, but he nevertheless became an army officer for a brief time during the post-war revolutionary period and soon became the most powerful man in Hungary.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Horthy rose through the ranks during the Great War, eventually ending up as the captain of SMS Novara, and gained a reputation for aggressiveness, which interestingly did not persist when he became regent.
                            While in this position, Horthy led the Austro-Hungarian navy during the Battle of the Strait of Otranto, which was to become his crowning achievement.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The Battle of the Strait of Otranto was an attempt to break the Allied blockade of Austria-Hungary. Horthy led a small fleet to attack the blockaders, but the Allies responded with much greater force.
                            It was because of his aggressive actions that he managed to repel a superior fleet, though the Austro-Hungarian position was very precarious at all times during the battle - Horthy was badly injured in the fighting.
                            This battle had little strategic effect on the remainder of the war, but Horthy became wildly popular as a result of it.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            In 1918, the exhausted crews of several Austro-Hungarian ships docked in Cattaro mutinied and demanded an end to the war and better living conditions.
                            The mutineers were put down and Horthy replaced the previous Commander-in-Chief of the Austro-Hungarian navy, becoming an admiral in the process.
                            However, Hungary was landlocked after the war, so Horthy retired to his estate, but it soon became clear that Hungary still needed her aging admiral.
                        </li>
                        <li id = "text-1">
                            Towards the end of 1918, as the Great War drew to a close, the Aster Revolution broke out in Hungary. War-weary soldiers and protestors participated in what amounted to a coup, establishing a republic.<sup><a href = "#footnote-1">[1]</a></sup>
                            At this time, Horthy had no desire to enter politics, but several calamitous events followed which would force him back into the public eye.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The new government, led by the "red count" Mihály Károlyi, was social democratic. Károlyi, a pacifist, reluctantly ordered the disarmament of the then-massive Hungarian army.
                            This action, which seemed like it would bring peace to Hungary, was to result in severe consequences which even today continue to affect Hungarian politics and foreign affairs.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            With Hungary no longer a military threat, Romania, Czechoslovakia, and Serbia invaded Hungary several times to claim territory for themselves.
                            Historic Hungary was a massive empire of many cultures, many of which had been demanding autonomy or independence for some time, and Hungary's response was Hungarisation policies.
                            As a result, Hungary received no sympathy from the outside world as her territories shrunk, and this unsurprisingly angered many Hungarians - including the communists.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The Great War is often said to have ended on "the eleventh hour of the eleventh day of the eleventh month," but that was merely an armistice and fighting continued in the east for several years afterwards.
                                    As Winston Churchill put it, "[t]he war of the giants is over. The wars of the pygmies is about to begin."
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The communists, led by Béla Kun, staged a coup and immediately began a revolutionary Red Terror to silence all opposition.
                            Gyula Károlyi, Mihály's cousin, created an opposition government and invited Horthy to command the fledgeling National Army.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            The Romanians easily defeated Kun's disorganised and demoralised forces, capturing Budapest and occupying most of the country.
                            During the chaotic occupation, Horthy led the National Army to restore order across Hungary, effecting a White Terror across Hungary to purge communist sympathisers.
                            This unfortunately included many innocent Jews who had nothing to do with Kun, and Horthy effectively let the anti-Semitic elements of his army run amok for two years.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    The White Terror can be considered a precursor to Horthy's actions during the Holocaust. Horthy was an anti-Semite, but he did not participate in the White Terror, nor did he explicitly allow it.
                                    Horthy later stepped in to prevent more serious excesses, but he surely could have intervened earlier if he wanted to do so.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            After the Romanians withdrew from Hungary, Gyula's government re-established the monarchy but could not crown the previous king due to anti-Habsburg sentiment by the Allies.
                            As a result, a regency was established to govern until a monarch could be found. Horthy was elected regent, granted essentially the powers of a king, and became the most powerful man in Hungary.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Shortly afterwards, the Allies presented the Treaty of Trianon to the Hungarians. It is, to this day, a major national trauma in Hungary.
                            Two-thirds of the pre-war Hungarian territory were transferred to the victorious Allies, and with them went one-third of all Hungarians living in pre-war Hungary.
                            Outrage over the loss of lands belong to the centuries-old Hungarian realm was widespread, although some territories were the subject of more attention than others.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    In some areas, such as Szekelyland (part of Transylvania) and southern Slovakia, Hungarians formed an outright majority and still do to this day.
                                    Hungarians living in these two territories remain major sticking points in modern, European geopolitics.
                                </li>
                                <li>In other areas, such as Vojvodina and Crisana (part of Transylvania), Hungarians were a large minority. Many Hungarian efforts at revision included these areas.</li>
                                <li>Finally, areas such as Croatia, Mura, and Burgenland were basically void of Hungarians. There was little official interest in regaining these areas.</li>
                                <li>
                                    The two most contested territories were Transylvania and southern Slovakia.
                                    Transylvania (majority Romanian) had long been the heartland of several Hungarian states and southern Slovakia was taken from Hungary almost as a punitive measure.
                                    Even today, many Hungarians believe that these territories rightfully belong to Hungary, even though the government has made no official claims to that end.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>With the Great War over, Horthy looked towards Hungary's future. However, like many others in Europe, looking forwards for Horthy meant looking backwards at what was lost and at what could have been.</li>

                    <h2>Interwar Period<sup><a href = "#interwar">#</a></sup></h2>
                    <p>The Horthy Regency refers to the period between 1920 and 1944, when Horthy ruled Hungary as a dictator. In the interwar years, Horthy focused on reconstruction and remilitarisation, with his ultimate goal being revision of Trianon.</p>

                        <dd id = "text-2">
                            Although Horthy was certainly a dictator, he still held somewhat free and fair elections, so despite the fact that only one party ever won elections<sup><a href = "#footnote-2">[2]</a></sup>, there was still quite the political power struggle during this time.
                            Horthy's prerogatives included appointing and dismissing prime ministers, and so his regency can be classified into eras based on who he chose to be his prime minister and what the ruling party called itself.
                            <dl>

                                    István Bethlen, like Horthy, was an Anglophile, and British support for Hungary did much to keep the government afloat. With few exceptions, Bethlen remained very popular until the Great Depression.
                                    Notably, the labour movement (still led by the bitter social democrats) made their peace with Horthy's regime, although the Bethlen-Peyer Pact was considered a betrayal by most of the left.
                                    In addition to the Bethlen-Peyer Pact, Bethlen became known for his policy of "consolidation," a package of conservative social policies and liberal economic policies, which stabilised Hungary after years of war.
                                    Additionally, Bethlen sought a revisionist alliance with Italy, setting Hungary on a long path that would eventually end in an alliance with Germany.
                                    Other than that, one other policy was to become famous: a law which effectively restricted the number of Jews in higher education. It was the first law of its kind in interwar Europe, and it would not be the last.

                                            Bethlen's liberal economic policies were unable to weather the Great Depression and after a brief premiership by the aging Gyula Károlyi, Gyula Gömbös became Prime Minister.
                                            Gömbös was unquestionably a fascist, but Horthy asked that he not implement any anti-Jewish policies, publicly renounce anti-Semitism, and maintain parliamentary government; Gömbös actually did obey these requests.
                                            Gömbös implemented some degree of corporatism and brought Hungary closer to Italy, then to Germany, but Hitler thought that Gömbös was too pro-Jewish and refused to back him.
                                            However, the German-Hungarian trade deals that helped to pull Hungary out of the Great Depression kept Hungary reliant on Germany for economic support, and the reliance would only grow in the years to come.

                                            When Gömbös died, Kálmán Darányi was appointed Prime Minister, and he was unable to strengthen contacts with the UK.
                                            With no other options, Darányi pulled closer to Italy (Mussolini was still opposed to Germany at the time), then to Germany once it became clear that Germany posed an existential threat to Hungary.
                                            Although Darányi was originally a conservative, over time he became more and more pro-fascist, and Horthy forced him out of the government as a result. Darányi's successor, Béla Imrédy, faced the same fate.

                                    Pál Teleki became Prime Minister during a very dark time for Hungary. Some months after the beginning of his premiership, which he spent passing anti-Jewish laws, Germany invaded Poland.
                                    <a href = "https://www.bbc.com/travel/article/20170210-two-countries-as-close-as-brothers" target = "_blank">Most Hungarians were virulently opposed to war with Poland</a>, and Teleki was no exception.
                                    An Anglophile like Horthy, Teleki sought every means possible to peel Hungary away from Germany, but the Allies refused to have anything to do with Hungary, which meant that Hungary had no choice but to join Germany and Italy.
                                    When the Axis invaded Yugoslavia, Teleki again tried to maintain non-belligerence, but the Germans secretly and unofficially secured military transit on Hungarian railroads to invade Yugoslavia.
                                    Teleki immediately shot himself, and Hungary entered the Second World War on the side of the Axis.

                            Horthy was not a politically active person, but he had a vision for Hungary. While his prime ministers did the politicking, Horthy watched from the sidelines to make sure that everything was moving in his favour.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Many of Horthy's prime ministers were Anglophiles, much like himself. It was reasonable to believe that the UK would support Hungary, as Bethlen rebuilt Hungary using British loans.
                                    However, as the interwar period progressed, Horthy pushed aside his own preferences in favour of Germany, which, after annexing Austria, actually bordered Hungary and posed an existential threat.
                                </li>
                                <li>Horthy's primary foreign policy goal was the revision of Trianon. This was achieved at a great cost - specifically, strengthening Germany. Besides Italy, no other country was willing to support Hungary's claims.</li>
                                <li>Though Horthy was a conservative, he did appoint some fascist prime ministers. Mostly, however, he appointed conservatives like himself until it became politically dangerous to do so.</li>
                                <li>Horthy and Purgly may not have been open participants in politics, but their children would be. Once the war began, István Horthy and Miklós Horthy Jr spoke out extensively and gained high positions in the government.</li>
                                <li>
                                    Horthy's anti-Semitism showed through his prime ministers. It is telling that, when a world war was raging right outside Hungary's borders, Teleki went out of his way to pass several anti-Jewish laws and Horthy did not veto them.
                                    Some argue that Horthy's actions during the war exonerate him, but the man was not a saint, and his memory continues to be a thorn in Hungarian-Israeli relations today.

                    <h2>Second World War<sup><a href = "#ww2">#</a></sup></h2>
                    <p>Once Hungary entered the Second World War, Horthy and his prime ministers began to act quite differently. Some of his actions then are the most controversial, while others laud him as a hero.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Firstly, Horthy did not want war. If he could have, he would have made all of his territorial demands and then become neutral. Germany's support, however, had a price, and Horthy was initially willing to pay it.</li>
                        <li>
                            István was not willing to pay the price. At all stages of the war, while still alive, he protested extremely loudly against fascism, anti-Semitism, and Germany. He was well-received in the Hungarian Diet and by the general public.
                            In fact, "the Little Regent" was generally expected to succeed his father (Horthy was growing very old and was getting sick more often), and was elected Deputy Regent in 1942 to formally do so.
                            This fact alone proves that Hungary was not a fascist puppet state at this point in time; fascist elements, such as corporatism, were in place, and fascists were popular, but Hungary was too conservative for such a radical ideology.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Southern Slovakia, Carpathian Ruthenia, northern Transylvania, Backa, and Mura were annexed by Hungary either prior to or during the war, and their non-Hungarian inhabitants were not treated well.
                            Hungary set out on a campaign to pacify these regions by force, which in one instance resulted in the Novi Sad Massacre. Jews in these regions were also taken by the Germans to be executed, and the Hungarians did nothing to stop them.
                            It is possible that they did not know what was to happen, or that they could not have done much as merely an occupying force for a much more powerful army, since Horthy would later respond more forcefully to protect the Jews of Hungary proper.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Hungary only really fought in the USSR, her historic enemy (Russia included), and István served there as a fighter pilot. First, István was killed in a plane accident, thus removing one major source of anti-German sentiment.
                            Next, the entire Hungarian Second Army was destroyed by Soviet forces during the Battle of Stalingrad. The Axis was obviously not going to win this war, and Horthy was no longer willing to pay Germany's price.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Miklós Jr made himself prominent at this time. Previously a diplomat and a businessman, Miklós Jr helped set up the Emergency Bureau, which was intended to make peace with the Allies.
                            Like István, Miklós Jr was strongly anti-German and made every effort to secretly leave the war. Germany acted, however, and immediately occupied Hungary, sidelining Horthy and setting up a puppet government.
                            It was also at this time that most of Hungary's Jews were deported to Germany, an action which continues to stain Horthy's reputation. Still, it is doubtful that he could have prevented the deportations.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            While essentially a prisoner in his own castle, Horthy still sought ways to leave the war. His time came when a coup in Romania led to Romania joining the Allies.
                            The chaos caused by this event allowed Horthy to oust his collaborationist prime minister, militarily stop the deportation of the Jews, and announce a ceasefire with the Allies.
                            Unfortunately, fascist elements in Hungary were by then too strong to be removed, and they launched a coup against Horthy with German military support and captured Miklós Jr.
                            Additionally, many elements of the Hungarian army considered capitulation to the USSR to be the worst possible outcome, and fought on under German command to the bitter end.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            While imprisoned, and with his son's life at stake, Horthy agreed to step down and let a fascist puppet government take over.
                            This "Government of National Unity" would continue the deportation of the Jews, and this is when Raoul Wallenberg famously acted to protect the remaining Jews.
                            Horthy was transferred from prison to prison, eventually ending up in American hands, and testified in the Nuremburg Trials before living out the rest of his life in Portugal.

                    <h2>Horthy's Legacy<sup><a href = "#legacy">#</a></sup></h2>
                    <p>
                        It should be obvious that I think of Horthy as an incredibly interesting historical figure, perhaps the most interesting of them all.
                        An admiral without a navy and a regent without a king, Horthy has left quite the complex legacy, and I want to present it in a non-dichotomous format; that is, I want Horthy to be seen as more than just an anti-Semite or a nationalist.
                        Historical discussion is much more productive when it is nuanced, and Horthy's legacy is still felt today.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li id = "text-3">
                            Horthy was unquestionably an anti-Semite, and this dominates most discussion about him. While not directly comparable, I do want to mention Boris III of Bulgaria.
                            Boris III was in a similar situation to Horthy, himself being anti-Semitic, and Boris III did consent to the deportation of the Jews of Vardar and Thrace.
                            However, Boris III stopped the deportations and then put the Jews into forced labour battalions, claiming that their deportation would be hugely detrimental to the Bulgarian economy.
                            Horthy did no such similar thing<sup><a href = "#footnote-3">[3]</a></sup>, but Hungary was on the border with Germany and anti-Semitism was not as widespread among Bulgarians as it was among Hungarians.
                            In the end, Horthy did militarily stop the deportations and Hitler always considered him to be too pro-Jewish, much like Gömbös, yet, Boris III is now a hero while Horthy is vilified.
                            Boris III obviously did much more for the Jews of Bulgaria than Horthy did for the Jews of Hungary, but perhaps the difference lay in circumstances rather than outlook.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Horthy was objectively not a fascist, having banned fascist parties, been overthrown by one, and opposed the German war effort from the outset, but he was definitely no liberal.
                            At no point did he support or implement true democracy, remaining a rightist dictator throughout his entire regency.
                            The question then becomes whether he was a benevolent dictator, similar to what people call Kuan-Yew Lee or Mustafa Kemal Atatürk.
                            Some people hate Horthy because (among other things) he was an autocrat, and it is perfectly fine to have such standards, but his legacy is far more complex than that.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Horthy was a nationalist, which is the main reason why some people have a positive opinion of him. As previously mentioned, many Hungarians still believe that some of their lost lands should be returned.
                            Horthy's entire foreign policy was dictated by his desire to revise Trianon, and generally people do not fault him for this. People do, however, fault him for stooping so low as to make a deal with the devil (Germany) to this end.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Horthy's domestic policies are not often the subject of much discussion, and to be fair he was not exceptional in this area. However, his policies should not be discounted.
                            Horthy effectively prevented fascism from spreading for years, rebuilt and greatly improved the Hungarian economy, and preserved her independence for a very long time.
                            Viktor Orbán has called Horthy a statesman, which is definitely an exaggeration, but rarely anybody even attempts to make this argument; those who do are immediately called anti-Semites.
                            <ul>
                                <li>
                                    Let me put this another way. Napoleon was an emperor (an autocrat) and caused millions of deaths on the battlefields of Europe.
                                    I do consider him an admirable figure for his domestic policies and tactical genius, and many French people feel the same way.
                                    Napoleon has a nuanced legacy, and many also freely admit that they dislike Napoleon for betraying the Revolution or killing millions, but this is not politically controversial. The same is not true for Horthy.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            I hope that I have presented here an unbiased, reliable account of Horthy's life.
                            I find him to be unjustly ignored or debated about in the most asinine possible manner in the present day, but my little project here is unlikely to change anything. If it does, though, that would make me happy.
                            A historical figure as important as Horthy is should not be coalesced down to one word.

                            Horthy also created Jewish forced labour battalions, something that István strongly opposed. These battalions served in the USSR and were treated very poorly, which is far from what Boris III did.<sup><a href = "#text-3">^</a></sup>
