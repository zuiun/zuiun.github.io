                <h1>Fortress Kanto: The Kingmaker of Japan</h1>

                    This is my capstone project for HIS 378 (Capstone in History).
                    My chosen research question was "how the Kanto contribute to the unification of Japan?"

                        I manually scanned that map (it was a fold-out map) out of a book, then coloured it in digitally.
                        It honestly might have been more labour-intensive and physically difficult to make this poster than to write the thesis...
