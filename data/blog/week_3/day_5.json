The singer is a former actress and god taking the stage for the last time playing a woman about to sacrifice herself for a village that hates her. It covers the woman's regrets in life and the idealism with which she sees the world, then she dissolves into water, thus restoring the village's water supply. The song intentionally parallels the life of said actress, so, call me sentimental, but she's my favourite character in all of fiction and this song resonated with me deeply.\">here</code>.",
