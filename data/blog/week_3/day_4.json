                "Anyway, I once again apologise for not being in the picture, but the poster was actually behind a bush, so it was hard to get a picture in the first place..."

                "I can't say that there's much that would inherently suggest it, other than dance culture?",
                "This may just be a coincidence, but of the states listed, only Greece and Austria have not been under protracted communist rule.",
                "I think the dance connection is more likely, though neither is particularly convincing.",
                "What's more interesting is that this is the only advertisement for Hispanic (non-US) music that I've seen in all of Hungary.",
                "It may be that, in the future, Hispanic artists will be all the rage in Hungary.",
                "Right now, that isn't the case, but, by touring here, Habana Social Club leaves that possibility open.",
                "Maybe, in twenty years, musicologists will look back upon this tour as having connected Central Europe to Latin America, two historically disparate regions.",
                "That would definitely be an interesting cultural exchange."
