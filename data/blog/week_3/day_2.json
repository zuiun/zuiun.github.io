                "\"Dragostea Din Tei\" is a song that I discovered through a meme.",
                "After an arduous adventure (because I didn't have Shazam at the time), I found it, and, to my extreme surprise, it was in Romanian!",
                "First of all, let's ignore the obvious questions (are Romanian and Moldavian separate languages, and do Romanians and Moldavians have separate cultural identities), because, in this case, I'd say they don't matter.",
                "In caf√©s and restaurants, I usually hear Hungarian or Anglophone music, so to hear a song in Romanian was very surprising.",
                "Isn't there supposed to be some kind of Hungarian-Romanian rivalry? In Szeged, the answer is apparently no.",
                "Rather, whoever controlled the music clearly had impeccable taste, and this song represents a common European cultural heritage.",
                "Hungarians and Romanians clearly have gripes about each others' governments, but nothing like the vitriolic hatred that far-right rhetoric might suggest.",
                "Although I recognise that poorer Hungarians wouldn't be going to this particular dessert shop, I feel like that doesn't really matter.",
                "Catchy music has a tendency to transcend cultural and political differences.",
                "I mean, I don't speak a word of Romanian, and I love this song! (My only Romanian friend has apparently never heard of it though.)"
