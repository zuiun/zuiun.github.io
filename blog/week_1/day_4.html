                    <h2>Babeș-Bolyai University<sup><a href = "#ubb">#</a></sup></h2>
                    <p>
                        This time, I actually think it would've been impossible to take a selfie with the billboard.
                        This was on top of a building on the way to UBB, but we all passed it together, so I hope this counts.
                        This billboard, unlike previous advertisements, doesn't have a list of participants.
                        However, it is a competition, and entry is free, which probably makes it more appealing than other music events.
                        Once again, Jazz in the Park has a <a href = "https://jazzinthepark.ro/competitie/" target = "_blank">website</a>.

                    <h2>About Jazz in the Park<sup><a href = "#jazz_park">#</a></sup></h2>
                    <p>
                        By this point, I have a standard operating procedure for music events.
                        The only languages are Romanian (default) and English, but this is much less egregious of an issue since it doesn't literally take place in a Hungarian castle.
                        This particular festival is a competition, whose top two winners will be invited to perform at the main festival in September.
                        This competition thus features presumably mostly amateur bands - there are no easily recognisable names as in previous festivals, although I admit that I don't know modern jazz that well.

                    <p>
                        The list of performers is very diverse, and it seems to be all-European.
                        VeszprémFest suggests that there are a lot of Hungarian jazz bands, but the only one here seems to be from Austria.
                        I assume Abel Marton Nagy is a Hungarian living in Austria, which would suggest that ethnicity doesn't matter in music.
                        I can't see an Austrian band performing in Hungarian, while having a Hungarian at the lead of the band is also rather un-Austrian.
                        Jazz is fundamentally a fusion of cultures, so this particular combination seems rather appropriate here.
