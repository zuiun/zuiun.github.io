                <p>This is my blog post for 27 June 2024.</p>
                <section id = "banffy_castle">
                    <h2>Bánffy Castle<sup><a href = "#banffy_castle">#</a></sup></h2>
                    <p>
                        Once again, I didn't take a selfie, but we all went there together.
                        That counts as proof, right?
                        Anyway, Bánffy Castle is a historic Hungarian castle in Cluj that is still owned by the Bánffy family, which, frankly, is surprising.
                        One would imagine that, through several periods of Romanian rule, the castle would've been seized by the state, and it might be a reconciliation gesture that the Bánffy family continues to own the castle.
                        In any case, like VeszprémFest, Electric Castle has a <a href = "https://electriccastle.ro/" target = "_blank">website</a> with quite a bit to see.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <section id = "electric_castle">
                    <h2>About Electric Castle<sup><a href = "#electric_castle">#</a></sup></h2>
                    <p>
                        Firstly, unlike VeszprémFest, the website is primarily in English.
                        That may be a result of my computer language, but I'm not sure.
                        Either way, the list of performers on the banner suggests significant foreign attendance, such as Bring Me the Horizon.
                        One thing I find interesting is that Subcarpați, a Romanian band, almost shares a name with Kárpátia, a Hungarian band.
                        I can't say I'm a fan of Subcarpați's music, but they aren't right-wing apologists like Kárpátia, which is, admittedly, the bare minimum.
                        Anyway, the lack of a Hungarian translation for the website suggests Romanian cultural dominance even over an event taking place in a Hungarian castle, but I might be reading too much into it.
                        There's a very large variety of international artists taking place here, which is great to see in the multicultural city of Cluj. </p>
                    <p>
                        I do find it a little odd that I couldn't find any Hungarian performers, though I don't want to be cynical and suggest active discrimination by the event organisers.
                        Still, it's a bit strange.
