                <p>This is my first blog post for 8 July 2024.</p>

                    <h2>Votive Church<sup><a href = "#votive_church">#</a></sup></h2>
                    <p>
                        This is a picture from Szeged, in the Votive Church.
                        In stark contrast to the light-hearted environment of Sugar &amp; Candy, the Votive Church was rather awe-inspiring; it's huge and adorned with lovely decorations, and (not surprisingly) what caught my eye the most were the coats of arms by the organ.
                    </p>

                        On the way out, I ran across a poster advertising organ recitals.
                        That definitely sounds interesting.
                        Most of my piano recitals have taken place in churches, so that felt relatable for a single second, and then I remembered that I don't actually play the organ.
                        Anyway, the recitals have a <a href = "http://domorgona.hu/" target = "_blank">website</a>, which surprised me greatly.

                    <h2>About Orgonakoncertek<sup><a href = "#orgonakoncertek">#</a></sup></h2>
                    <p>
                        First of all, the organists are all from different countries.
                        Obviously, I expect all of them to be Catholic, and indeed they are all from Catholic-dominant or Catholic-influenced states.
                        Catholicism has historically been and continues to be a unifying force around the world, especially as the Catholic centre of power moves towards Latin America.
                        Religion, though, is not my focus.
                        Music is!
                        And these performers are playing European music.
                        We see German, French, Hungarian, and Italian composers on the setlists, which isn't surprising, and the distribution is not confined to organist nationality, which is slightly surprising.
                        They also aren't necessarily playing religious music, which is important.
                        Religion brought these organists together, but the culture they're sharing is music.
                        It is unfortunate, though, that music from non-Catholic cultures was left out, but that's to be expected in a Catholic church.
                    </p>

                        Also, a word about the coats of arms - I just think it's interesting that these organists are coming together to perform before a mosaic of Greater Hungary.
                        Most of the regions depicted are no longer in Hungary, and it would totally have been interesting if a Croat played in front of a symbol of Hungarian domination of Croatia.
