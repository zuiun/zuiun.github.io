                        This is the last of my stash from Pécs and also the last blog post (I saved the best for last!).
                        Alright, that's not true.
                        I haven't touched a piano in months, so I'm very rusty.
                        But anyway, as can be seen, there's a public piano in Pécs Station.
                        When I saw it, I didn't want to touch it.
                        I told two of my friends about it, and they both ordered me to play it, saying that there was nothing to lose.
                        And so, after staring at it for a while, I went to play - actually, this kid saw me staring and immediately began slamming the keys.
                        He then said something in Hungarian and seemingly offered the piano to me?
                        I just told him that I don't speak Hungarian (in flawless Hungarian).
                        Then, I began playing.

                        "La vaguelette" is my favourite song, full stop.
                        I've spent actual months trying to learn it, and I'm still not great at it.
                        The song itself isn't important as the act of playing it, so I'll write the story behind it in a <code title = "Long story short, La vaguelette is a song with a double meaning. The singer is a former actress and god taking the stage for the last time playing a woman about to sacrifice herself for a village that hates her. It covers the woman's regrets in life and the idealism with which she sees the world, then she dissolves into water, thus restoring the village's water supply. The song intentionally parallels the life of said actress, so, call me sentimental, but she's my favourite character in all of fiction and this song resonated with me deeply.">tooltip</code>.
                        Anyway, La vaguelette was written by a Chinese studio (yes, it's from Genshin Impact...), sung in French (performed by Cécilia Cara, who's apparently quite famous in France), and I have brought it to Hungary.
                        The only way you could make this more culturally mixed is if someone started doing a French Algerian dance or something.
                        Of course, I played some other pieces too, including the only one I know by Ernő Dohnányi.
                        There's stories all over the world of a musician, armed with nothing but an instrument and passion, journeying abroad to spread music.
                        I never thought that I'd be one of those people (for about fifteen minutes).
                        Even if nobody but that kid cared about my music, I still contributed somewhat to a worldwide cultural heritage.
                        I mean, how else were these average Hungarians going to be exposed to Pat Metheny's "Letter from Home" (although I know jazz is pretty popular in Hungary)?
                        They probably don't have that oppportunity in daily life.
                        I didn't do very much, but others do, and musicians have a way of getting into people's heads; in return, they might adopt local influences into their music and forge connections.
                        They bring a piece of Hungary with them wherever they go, and so I think it's fair to say that musicians help Hungary connect with the world.

                        By the way, PLEASE ignore the video, as I have a way better recording of this song <a href = "https://youtu.be/gPK487joiDY?feature=shared&amp;t=1136" target = "_blank">here</a> :)
                        I'm embarrassed just posting this blog.
                        I only put the video there because I need proof :(
