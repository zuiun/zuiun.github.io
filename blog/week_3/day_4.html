                        This is another picture from Szeged, from when we went to the Ferenc Móra Museum.
                        In all honesty, of all the posters that exist, this is not what I expected to see.
                        This would not be out of place in Florida or under communist rule, but seems truly bizarre now.
                        I mean, Szeged looks like it came straight out of the American dream.
                        Anyway, I once again apologise for not being in the picture, but the poster was actually behind a bush, so it was hard to get a picture in the first place...

                    <p>
                        Habana Social Club, a Cuban band focusing on Hispanic music, is having its farewell tour.
                        I definitely find it interesting that this is taking place in Europe.
                        I can't say that there's much that would inherently suggest it, other than dance culture?
                        This may just be a coincidence, but of the states listed, only Greece and Austria have not been under protracted communist rule.
                        I think the dance connection is more likely, though neither is particularly convincing.
                        What's more interesting is that this is the only advertisement for Hispanic (non-US) music that I've seen in all of Hungary.
                        It may be that, in the future, Hispanic artists will be all the rage in Hungary.
                        Right now, that isn't the case, but, by touring here, Habana Social Club leaves that possibility open.
                        Maybe, in twenty years, musicologists will look back upon this tour as having connected Central Europe to Latin America, two historically disconnected regions.
                        That would definitely be an interesting cultural exchange.
